This is the home of the documentation of the Wordpress Plugin [Geolocation IP Detection](https://wordpress.org/plugins/geoip-detect/).

Documentation (How to use it):
* [[API: PHP]] - for themes or plugins
* [[API: Shortcodes]] - if you don't know how to code PHP
* [[API: Shortcodes for Contact Form 7]] - Integration into CF7 forms
* [[API: AJAX]] - if you are using a page cache, this is a great option. You need to code in JS, though.
